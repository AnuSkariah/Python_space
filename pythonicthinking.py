#follow PEP style  of writing code:
#few major ones: In a file, functions and classes should be seperated by two blank lines
#In a class, methods should be seperated by one blank line
#classes and exceptions should be in CapitalizedWord format
#Module-levelconstants constants should be in ALL_CAPS


#bytes, str, unicode
#two types of that represent seq if characters: bytes and str
#instances of bytes contain raw 8-bit values and Instances of str contain Unicode characters
